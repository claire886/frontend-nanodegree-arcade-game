Open index.html file and the game is ready to play.

Use arrow keys(up, right, down and left) to move the player from grass to water. The player has to cross the road to get to the water side. There are enemies going through the road and the goal is to avoid collision. 

If a collision happens, the game is over and will restart again.

If the player gets to the water side, you will gain one point. Each time after the player gets to the water side, the player will return to the starting point to play another round. At the same time, one more enemy is added on the road. As your score is getting higher, there are more enemies on the road and it is more difficult to get to the water side.
